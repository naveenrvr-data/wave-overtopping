Earlier, prediction models were developed using deep learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). 
While these models could achieve good prediction metrics, interpreting the results was challenging. 
This research aims to implement machine learning techniques on the data to predict wave overtopping discharge. The goal is to achieve comparable prediction metrics to ANN while also enabling easier interpretation of the results. 
Additionally, the study will analyze which features are most important in predicting wave overtopping.
